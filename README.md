# Crimes on Women Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset on crimes against women in various states across multiple years, focusing specifically on rape cases. The goal of the analysis is to identify trends, including:
1. The state with the highest number of reported rape cases each year.
2. The year-over-year trend in the number of rape cases.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis (`CrimesOnWomenData.csv`) contains the following columns:
- `State`: Name of the state.
- `Year`: The year the data was recorded.
- `Rape`: Number of reported rape cases.
- Additional columns with counts of other crime types.

This data is processed to calculate and visualize:
1. The state with the highest number of rape cases each year.
2. The total number of rape cases over time.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis steps are outlined in the Jupyter Notebook `analysis.ipynb` and include:
1. Loading and preprocessing the data.
2. Calculating the state with the highest number of rape cases each year.
3. Summing the number of rape cases per year to observe trends over time.
4. Visualizing both the total cases per year and the states with the highest cases each year.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CrimesOnWomenAnalysis.git
   cd CrimesOnWomenAnalysis
   ```

2. Make sure the dataset `CrimesOnWomenData.csv` is in the project directory.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes two main visualizations:
1. **Total Rape Cases per Year**: A line plot showing the total number of cases recorded each year.
2. **State with the Highest Rape Cases Each Year**: A bar plot showing the state with the highest reported cases for each year.
